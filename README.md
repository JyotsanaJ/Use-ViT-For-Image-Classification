# vision-transformer
This repository contains code to utilize Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification tasks. ViT has shown remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, particularly in image classification, by leveraging self-attention mechanisms.

## Requirements
    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    torchvision
    Transformers library

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```python
pip install torch torchvision transformers
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JyotsanaJ/Use-ViT-For-Image-Classification.git
```

2. Run cells in the downloaded notebooks to see how to each layer works. 
3. Also to see how we can use pretrained models in tensorflow and pytorch.
